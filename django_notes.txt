* Django is a python framework that makes it easier to create web sites using Python.
* Django takes care of the difficult stuff so that you can concentrate on building your web applications.
* Django emphasizes reusability of components, also referred to as DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself) and comes with ready-to-use features like login system, databases connection and CRUD operations.

--- How does Django Work? ---
* Django follows the MVT(Model-View-Template) design pattern.

----> Model - The data you want to present, usually data from a database.
* In Django, the data is delivered as an Object Relational Mapping (ORM), which is a technique designed to make it easier to work with databases.

* The most common way to extract data from a database is SQL. One problem with SQL is that you have to have a pretty good understanding of the database structure to be able to work with it.

* Django, with ORM, makes it easier to communicate with the database, without having to write complex SQL statements.

----> View - A request handler that returns the relevant template and content-based on the request from the user.

* A view is a function or method that takes http requests as arguments, imports the relevant model(s), and finds out what data to send to the template, and returns the final result.

----> Template - A text file(like HTML file) containing the layout of the web page, with logic on how to display the data.

* Templates are often .html files, with HTML code describing the layout of a web page, but it can also be in other file formats to present other results, but we will concentrate on .html files.


---- Flow of the Django ----
1. Django receives the URL, checks the urls.py file, and calls the view that matches the URL.
2. The view, located in views.py, checks for relevant models.
3. The models are imported from the models.py file.
4. The view then sends the data to a specified template in the template folder.
5. The template contains HTML and Django tags, and with the data it returns finished HTML content back to the browser.
